/**
 * <h1>Search in Rotated Sorted Array</h1>
 * <p>There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).
 * <p>
 * Prior to being passed to your function, nums is rotated at an unknown pivot index k (0 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].
 * <p>
 * Given the array nums after the rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.
 * <p>
 * You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.</p>
