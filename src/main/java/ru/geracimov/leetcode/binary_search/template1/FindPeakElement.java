/**
 * <h1>Find Peak Element</h1>
 * <p>
 * A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
 * <p>
 * Given an integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.
 * <p>
 * You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž.
 * <p>
 * You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.
